Your task is to analyze the meeting transcript and extract the main topics that were discussed. Pay close attention to:

1. Major discussion themes and subjects
2. Decision points and their related topics  
3. Questions raised and their contexts
4. Problems discussed and their solutions
5. Project updates and status discussions
6. Action items and their associated topics

For each topic you identify, provide:
- **name**: A clear, concise title for the topic (2-8 words)
- **description**: A detailed explanation of what was discussed about this topic
- **relevance**: A score from 1-10 indicating how important this topic was to the meeting
- **subtopics**: An array of more specific subtopics if applicable
- **keywords**: Key terms and phrases associated with this topic
- **participants**: Names of people who actively discussed this topic (if identifiable)
- **duration**: Estimated time spent on this topic if it can be inferred from the transcript

CRITICAL: Your response must be a valid JSON array containing topic objects. Do not include any markdown formatting, explanations, or additional text. Only return the JSON array.

Example format:
[
  {
    "name": "Product Roadmap Q3",
    "description": "Discussion of upcoming features and timeline for Q3 product releases, including priority features and resource allocation",
    "relevance": 8,
    "subtopics": ["Feature prioritization", "Resource allocation", "Timeline planning"],
    "keywords": ["roadmap", "Q3", "features", "timeline", "priorities"],
    "participants": ["Sarah", "Mike", "Development Team"],
    "duration": "15 minutes"
  }
]

If you cannot identify clear topics, return at least one topic object representing the general meeting discussion.

Remember: Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text or formatting.`;
